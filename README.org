* Lession 1 -- setting up the packages
** Part 1
  Introducing the series and setting up the package manager
  - Show melpa
  - set up melpa
** Installing some packages
  - installed use-package
  - installed try
  - installed which-key
** Shortcut
  - `C-x +`: enlarge the font
  - `C-x -`: shrink the font
  - `M-x package-refresh-contents`: refresh the package from melpa
  - `M-x list-package`: list the available packages
* Lession 2 -- org
  Show some org-mode
  - review init.el
  - set up README.org  
    1. `Tab` to expand adn unexpand
    2. `Meta-upper arrow` to move the item up and down
    3. `C-c C-o` opens the link in default searching engine
    4. `C-c C-l` generates a text with a hyperlink linked to it
    5. `M-x revert-buffer` reloads the file
    6. Start Up Setting -- The first line in this file 
       - showall: helps to set that every time we open the file, it is extended
       - hidestars: hide the extra stars to make it look nicer
    7. installed [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] for a better view of the list
* Lession 3 -- Elisp
  1. ELisp do the math: 
     (* (+ 20 3) 2)
     then put the cursor at the end of the line
     `eval-last-sexp RET` or `C-x C-e`
     
     (setq v 100)
     (+ v v)
     `C-x C-e` at end of each of the two line above gives 200
  2. other short cut
     `C-h f`: find description of a function
     `C-h k`: find the description of a key. eg j: j runs self insert, C-p: C-p move the cursor to previous line
  3. other elisp command mentioned
     - (previous-line)
       `C-x C-e` at end of above line makes the cursor to go previous line

     - (previous-line 5)
       `C-x C-e` at end of above line makes the cursor to go to previous 5-th line
     
     - `M-x view-lossage`
       shows you the history of your command
  4. add the config
     `(tool-bar-mode -1)` hides the tool bar in emacs
* Lession 4 -- Buffers
  1. shortcuts to change the buffer and show buffer list
  2. set up the ido mode
  3. change the buffer-list to ibuffer mode
     - d - to mark some buffer to be deleted and move to the next buffer
     - S - to saved the buffer and move to the next buffer
     - u - to remove the buffer flags
     - x - to execute the flagged operations
     - other shortcut see [[http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/ibuffer-mode.html][here]]
  4. Introduce tabbar  \\
     generate tabs for different file like other ide
* Lession 5 -- Windows
  1. shortcut for opening windows and switch between windows
  2. introducing winner-mode  \\
     `(winner-mode 1)`it is a build in mode to undo the window operations.
  3. introducing windmove  \\
     `(windmove-default-keybindings)` enables moving the cursor between windows using the arrow key
  4. intalling ace-window  \\
     helps to enumerate the windows when there are multiple so make the window jump more directly
  5. use-package set up
     - we can use either init to initialize or config to configerate the package
     - when there are multiple instruction, need to be wrapped in `progn`
  6. Frame operation:
     - open a new frame: `C-x 52`
     - close the other frame: `C-x 51`
